I have taken this health insurance for my parents. The duration for which this health insurance is eligible is three years, as you can see in the policyCertificate_Nominee_Details documents PDF file.

For this, the total payment I have made is ₹93,854, as shown on page 5 of the policyCertificate_Nominee_Details documents PDF file.

Hence, for one year, ₹93,854 divided by 3 equals ₹31,285, which I am mentioning as the amount.
